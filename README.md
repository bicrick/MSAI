## Course Content

### Machine Learning
- Homework assignments focusing on practical implementation and analysis
- Jupyter notebooks with Python code and documentation
- Analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance

### Optimization
- LaTeX documents containing mathematical proofs and analysis
- Implementation of optimization algorithms
- Graphical visualizations and results analysis

## Technical Details

### LaTeX Setup
The Optimization homework assignments use a consistent LaTeX setup with the following packages:
- article class with standard formatting
- amsmath, amsfonts, and amssymb for mathematical notation
- geometry for page layout
- graphicx for including figures
- listings for code blocks
- enumitem for lists
- fancyhdr for header/footer customization

### Python Environment
The Machine Learning assignments use:
- Python 3.12
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Common data science libraries (based on notebook content)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. For LaTeX documents:
   - Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live 2024)
   - Compile using pdflatex or your preferred LaTeX compiler
3. For Python notebooks:
   - Install required Python packages
   - Run using Jupyter Notebook/Lab
